# üéì Alumni Career Path Analysis
# üéØ Objective
This project aims to analyze the career trends of alumni from College A and College B, focusing on their course completion year and chosen paths such as Higher Studies, Self-Employment, or Service/Job. It demonstrates SQL skills such as database schema creation, data import, cleaning data by removing null values, string manipulation for consistent naming, cursor usage for data fetching, and career percentage calculations.
# üìù Project Structure
* Schema Creation: Creating the alumni database schema.
* Data Import: Importing six alumni career-related CSV files into MySQL tables.
* Data Cleaning: Removing null values and creating clean views.
* String Manipulation: Converting names to lowercase using procedures.
* Cursor Procedures: Fetching alumni names using cursors.
* Career Choice Analysis: Calculating career choice percentages for both universities.
# Tasks
### 1. Create new schema as alumni
```MySql
CREATE SCHEMA alumni;
USE alumni;

```MySql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE LowerCase ()
BEGIN
SELECT LOWER(Name) Name , LOWER(FatherName) FatherName, LOWER(MotherName) MotherName FROM college_a_hs;
SELECT LOWER(Name) Name, LOWER(FatherName) FatherName, LOWER(MotherName) MotherName FROM college_a_se;
SELECT LOWER(Name) Name, LOWER(FatherName) FatherName, LOWER(MotherName) MotherName FROM college_a_sj;
SELECT LOWER(Name) Name, LOWER(FatherName) FatherName, LOWER(MotherName) MotherName FROM college_b_hs;
SELECT LOWER(Name) Name, LOWER(FatherName) FatherName, LOWER(MotherName) MotherName FROM college_b_se;
SELECT LOWER(Name) Name, LOWER(FatherName) FatherName, LOWER(MotherName) MotherFather FROM college_b_sj;
END $$
DELIMITER ;

CALL LowerCase();
```
### 10. Write a query to create procedure get_name_collegeA using the cursor to fetch names of all students from college A.
```MySql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_name_collegeA (
INOUT getnameA TEXT(40000)   )
BEGIN
     DECLARE finished INT DEFAULT 0;
     DECLARE getnamelistA VARCHAR(16000) DEFAULT "" ;

				 SELECT Name from college_a_sj;
                 
	 DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER 
     FOR NOT FOUND SET finished = 1;
     
     OPEN getnamedetailA;
     
     getloop:
     LOOP
		FETCH getnamedetailA INTO getnamelistA;
        IF finished = 1 THEN
            LEAVE getloop;
		END IF;
        SET getnameA = CONCAT(getnamelistA," ; ",getnameA);
		END LOOP getloop;
        CLOSE getnamedetailA;
END $$
DELIMITER ;

SET @getnameA = "";
CALL get_name_collegeA(@getnameA);
SELECT @getnameA NamesA;
```

DELIMITER ;

SET @getnameB = "";
CALL get_name_collegeB(@getnameB);
SELECT @getnameB NamesB;
```
### 12. Calculate the percentage of career choice of College A and College B Alumni-- (w.r.t Higher Studies, Self Employed and Service/Job)Note: Approximate percentages are considered for career choices.
```MySql
SELECT ('Higher Studies') 'Career_choice',(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM college_a_hs )/((SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_hs) + (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_se)
+ (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_sj))*100 'College_A_Percentage',
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM college_b_hs )/((SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_hs) + (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_se)
+ (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_sj))*100 'College_B_Percentage' UNION 
SELECT 'Self_Employed',(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM college_a_se )/((SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_hs) + (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_se)
+ (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_sj))*100 'College_A_Percentage',
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM college_b_se )/((SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_hs) + (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_se)
+ (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_sj))*100 'College_B_Percentage'UNION
SELECT 'Service Jobs',(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM college_a_sj )/((SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_hs) + (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_se)
+ (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_a_sj))*100 'College_A_Percentage',
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM college_b_sj )/((SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_hs) + (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_se)
+ (SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM college_b_sj))*100 'College_B_Percentage';
```
# üìñ Conclusion
This project highlights my ability to apply SQL for real-world alumni career data analysis, including schema design, data cleaning, string manipulation, and cursor-based procedures. By calculating and comparing career choice percentages between two colleges, it demonstrates structured problem-solving, advanced query handling, and the skill to transform data into meaningful insights.
